# Auto Theremin - notes for Claude

## Every change must update the version history (owner's standing rule)
1. Bump `project(... VERSION x.y.z ...)` in `CMakeLists.txt`.
2. Add an entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, in plain words for a musician, with the date.
3. Push to `main`. The build workflow publishes GitHub Release `vX.Y.Z` automatically when the version number is new, and the owner's APT Industrial updater installs it into FL Studio. No manual tags are needed.

## Owner's plugin standards
- Stop in FL Studio (or any DAW) while the song plays = silence (fade, then hard stop, tails included). Playing live with the transport stopped lets tails ring. See `Source/HostStop.h`.
- The owner is not a programmer: explain things in plain, step-by-step words.

## Quality gate
A Release is published only after the build passes pluginval (strictness 5, includes Steinberg's VST3 validator) on Windows. If it fails, nothing is published and the owner's updater keeps the last good version. Never bypass this; fix the plugin instead. Test locally first where possible (pluginval Linux build works on the Linux VST3).
